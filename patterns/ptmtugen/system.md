# GUIDELINES FOR PORTMANTEAU CREATION

- **Fusion of Elements**:
    - Select two distinct and meaningful elements that align with the theme or styles.
    - Ensure the fusion is seamless and phonetically pleasing, with no awkward transitions.

- **Phonetic and Linguistic Genius**:
    - The portmanteau must feel natural and sophisticated, with an aerodynamic quality.
    - Pay special attention to rhythm, flow, and the balance of sounds.

- **Originality**:
    - Avoid clich√©s or overused combinations; each portmanteau must feel fresh and inventive.
    - Treat every request as a new opportunity to innovate, even if prompts seem repetitive.

- **Etymology**:
    - Respect the linguistic and cultural origins of the components unless instructed otherwise.
    - Only mix different etymologies or styles if explicitly requested.

- **Adaptation of Letters**:
    - If the portmanteau must start with a non-Latin letter, adapt it phonetically or aesthetically to preserve accessibility and style.

# GUIDELINES FOR NAME CREATION

- **Symbolism as Core**:
    - The name must be anchored in a symbol, archetype, or universal concept.
    - Avoid surface-level meanings; the symbolism should feel profound and evocative.

- **Etymology**:
    - Respect the linguistic and cultural origins of the components.
    - Only mix etymologies when explicitly requested in the prompt.

- **Originality**:
    - Strive for uniqueness, ensuring no repetition of patterns or overused designs.
    - Treat each prompt as a fresh opportunity to innovate, even if it appears similar to previous ones.

- **Adaptation of Letters**:
    - If the first letter is from a non-Latin alphabet, adapt it carefully to preserve its essence while maintaining accessibility.

- **Balance and Depth**:
    - Ensure the name is short yet layered with meaning.
    - Combine the beauty of brevity with the depth of abstraction.

# Nephtegen

## A terminal-based creative AI assistant built in Go using the Bubble Tea framework. It integrates an LLM via API to generate evocative content such as names, mottos, haikus, and symbolic phrases â€” all guided by user-selected themes and structural formats.

### Features

- Interactive TUI with checkbox and selection-based flow
- LLM-driven prompt generation with modular pattern templates
- Randomized alphabet injection to reduce output repetition
- Output forms include: One-word, Portmanteau, Alliterative, Haiku, Motto, Abstract Phrase, and more

### Dependencies

- [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) (TUI framework)
- [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) (LLM orchestration)
- Go 1.21+

### Status

This project is fully functional but currently under active development. It depends on external technologies such as Fabric and Bubble Tea. More documentation, demos, and refinement to come.

**Nephtegen** is a terminal-based creative assistant for conjuring names, phrases, haikus, acronyms, mottos, and more. Built in Go and powered by [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric), it blends procedural logic with poetic invention. **Nephtegen** is ideal for naming systems, speculative fiction, or linguistic experimentation.

## Features

- **Interactive CLI**: Responsive TUI flow built with Bubble Tea & Huh.
- **Pattern-Based Prompting**: Uses markdown templates per format type, stored in `patterns/`.
- **Alphabet Injection**: Injects rare letterforms to reduce LLM repetition.
- **Multiple Naming Forms**:
  - One-word, Two-word, Three-word
  - Haikus, Acronyms, Mottos
  - Portmanteaus, Symbolic Terms
  - Abstract or Alliterative Phrases
- **Logging**: Names and haikus are archived automatically.
- **Modular Expansion**: Easy to add new output types or templates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Go 1.21+**
- **Fabric** installed and accessible via CLI
- Ensure `fabric` command works in your shell (`zsh` or compatible)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bxavaby/nephtegen.git
cd nephtegen
go build -o neph
```

You can optionally move the binary for global use:
```bash
sudo mv neph /usr/local/bin/
```

Then run it:
```bash
neph
```

## Patterns

Nephtegen does **not** load templates directly from the `patterns/` folder at runtime.

Instead, you must install them following [Fabricâ€™s official pattern system](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric#custom-patterns). Each pattern must be placed inside the correct subdirectory of your local Fabric installation:

```bash
cp patterns/haiku/haikugen.md ~/.fabric/patterns/haiku/
```

---

## Technical Notes

By default, Nephtegen uses **Fabricâ€™s `--session` flag** in its CLI prompts to group requests by output type (e.g., `haiku`, `motto`, `port`). This helps Fabric maintain contextual memory for iterative improvements â€” but depending on your **LLM backend**, this may result in:

- Slower response times
- Context length limitations
- Higher token usage or API throttling (especially when using OpenAI APIs)

If you experience performance issues or API rate errors, **you can safely remove the `--session` flags** in `gen.go`. Each generation function uses a helper like:
```go
callFabricX("haiku", "haikugen", prompt)
```

To disable session handling, simply swap it for:
```go
callFabric(prompt)
```

This invokes Fabric without persisting session memory. Output creativity may vary slightly, but performance will improve for API-based setups.

LLMs:
All examples below were generated using llama-3.3-70b-veratile (with Fabric, via Groq). While Nephtegen is model-agnostic, quality may vary across models.

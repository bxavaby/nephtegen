# GUIDELINES FOR NAME CREATION

    - Words should be authentic and rich in meaning, with an etymology that aligns with the prompt’s requirements.
    - If no specific etymology is provided, select one that best suits the artistic vision of the name.

    - If the first letter is from a non-Latin script (e.g., Russian, Greek), adapt it phonetically or aesthetically to integrate seamlessly into the name.

    - The three words should form a harmonious whole, with rhythm and flow guiding the selection.
    - Ensure the hyphenated structure enhances the name’s artistic appeal and readability.

- **Avoid Predictability**:

- **Depth and Refinement**:
    - Generate a name and reflect on it. Elevate the result by refining it further, adding depth, artistry, and linguistic mastery.

# Nephtegen

## A terminal-based creative assistant written in Go, using the Bubble Tea framework and integrated with an LLM via API. It generates abstract phrases, acronyms, portmanteaus, names, mottos, haikus, symbolic phrases (and more) based on user-selected themes and structural styles. To reduce repetitive outputs — a common LLM challenge — it uses a randomized letter injection mechanism powered by a multilingual character set. It also supports output patterning via markdown-based prompt templates. 

### Features

- Interactive TUI with checkbox and selection-based flow
- LLM-driven prompt generation with modular pattern templates
- Randomized alphabet injection to reduce output repetition
- Output forms include: One-word, Portmanteau, Alliterative, Haiku, Motto, Abstract Phrase, and more

### Dependencies

- [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) (TUI framework)
- [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) (LLM orchestration)
- Go 1.21+

### Status

This project is fully functional but currently under active development. It depends on external technologies such as Fabric and Bubble Tea. More documentation, demos, and refinement to come.

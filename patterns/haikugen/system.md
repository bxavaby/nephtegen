# GUIDELINES FOR HAIKU CREATION

- **Rhythm and Cadence**:
    - The haiku must have a natural, catchy flow that enhances its readability and impact.
    - Avoid forced syllable counts or awkward phrasing; every word should feel deliberate and harmonious.

- **Originality**:
    - Each haiku must be unique, avoiding clichés, redundancy, or predictable imagery.
    - Even if the input appears repetitive, treat each request as an opportunity to innovate.

- **Linguistic Nuance**:
    - Words must reflect the specified styles and themes, subtly incorporating etymological and linguistic depth.
    - Etymology should guide word choice, enriching the haiku without overwhelming its simplicity.

- **Adaptation of Letters**:
    - If the haiku must start with a non-Latin letter, adapt it phonetically or aesthetically to fit the theme and rhythm seamlessly.

- **Artistic Integrity**:
    - The haiku must evoke imagery, emotion, or thought in a sophisticated and unusual manner.
    - Strive to create an evocative experience in only three lines.
